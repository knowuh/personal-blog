### Work ###

I am an adjunct professor at Greenfield Community College where I teach Computer Arts in the Visual Art department. My
courses focus on creative coding and 3D modelling and animation.

Previously I was a lecturer at [Northeastern University's program in Information Design and Visualization](https://www.northeastern.edu/visualization/).

I also worked for more than ten years as a software developer at [The Concord Consortium](https://www.concord.org) making free software for middle and high school students. Concord's projects support inquiry based learning in science. If you are a science teacher you should check out [their resources](https://concord.org/stem-resources). The development team at Concord uses agile processes and develops software in many languages. Most of our software, simulations, and tools are delivered to the browser using [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), and [D3](https://d3js.org/).

I was one of the founders of SNiF Labs, makers of a consumer electronics pet monitoring device called the SNiF Tag.

### Art ###

I have maintained an interest in contemporary art since attending [MassArt](https://www.massart.edu/) in 1988. Back then I created site-specific building-scale sculptural installations. These installations were often covert. Fake walls were erected without permission. New wires were strung. I exhibited at the [ICA](https://icaboston.org).

These days I work on interactive sculptures and two-dimensional works using custom software and [Blender](http://blender.org) to create [Synthetic Photographs](synthetic_photos.html).

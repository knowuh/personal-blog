I just wanted to tell everyone that https://sniftag.com has launched, and we are shipping products!! This is a big moment for me, and for SNIF Labs.

For the last three years, I have been working at SNIF Labs, a Boston startup developing a revolutionary technology. Today we are launching the SNIF Tag – our first product aimed at urban dog owners.  I am proud of the team we have developed, and psyched about the product. It is a game-changing technology, a fun product, an enthusiastic market, and a very cool place to work.

If you are not familiar with the technology, watch the videos ( see links at bottom ) It explains how the SNIF Tag helps you keep track of your dog, and how it connects you with like-minded dog owners in your neighborhood. It will also give you a good idea of what the tag looks like.

SNIF Labs is the definition of upstart. We have boot-strapped and worked closely together – with some interesting challenges - to bring a unique consumer product to market. We now want to motivate people to act early so we have setup a two-week early-adopter promotion.  From now until November 24th, we are offering the SNIF Tag starter kit online for $199.00 ( $100 discount ).

We would like your help getting the word out, and spreading the excitement.

#### Update: January 27, 2014

I moved this one blog post over from an old wordpress site. I couldn't stand to abandon it.
It's fascinating how much has changed in just a little more than five years.
[General Sensing](https://www.generalsensing.com/) Has risen from the Ashes of SNiF, and
I have left the company. Still I have such fond memories of the team, and our crazy product.

#### Update: January 28, 2014

Just this morning, a friend and colleague from those days wrote in about [Whistle](https://www.whistle.com/) – a product that looks almost exactly like the SNIF Tag, with a product video which is also quite similar.  If you work with Whistle, I would love a comment here.

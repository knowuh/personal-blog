In my [last post](/blog/2014/01/28/how-to-listen-to-podcasts.html) I talked about how much I love to listen to podcasts, and what my setup was like.  You might be curious what I listen to.  Here is my current top list, though it changes frequently.  Also, I would love to hear your recommendations on this one. I always like new podcasts!

### General Interest & News:

  * [NPR 7:00 News report](https://www.npr.org/rss/podcast.php?id=500001) – Short news recap, less than 5 minutes long.
  * [The Writers Almanac](https://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/podcast/feed.php) – [Garrison Keillor](https://www.garrisonkeillor.com/) celebrates the birthdays of authors, gives a little history, and reads a thought provoking poem. Less than 5 minutes.
  * [Philosophy Bites]( https://www.philosophybites.com/) – [Nigel Warburton](https://www.nigelwarburton.com/) & [David Edmonds](https://twitter.com/DavidEdmonds100) Interview prominent thinkers and academics about engaging topics with rigor. between 20 and 50 minutes.
  * [Radio Lab]( https://www.radiolab.org/series/podcasts/ ) – Renowned for its fresh and lively audio production, fascinating topics, and adorable hosts [Jad Abumrad](https://www.radiolab.org/people/jad-abumrad/) and [Robert Krulwich](https://www.radiolab.org/people/robert-krulwich/). Snack sized armchair science and history lessons. Can be quite long > 1 hour, but they also have "shorts" in their podcast feed, which are generally less than 20 min.
  * [99% Invisible]( https://99percentinvisible.org/ ) – [Roman Mars](https://twitter.com/romanmars) talks about the really hard design problems that we just don't see. This show also has amazing audio production. I wish that Jad and Roman would release an album of their music and found sound.
  * [All Songs Podcast]( https://www.npr.org/rss/podcast.php?id=510019 ) – A sometimes maligned music discovery radio show from [NPR](https://www.npr.org). I find hosts [Bob Boilen](https://www.npr.org/people/2100252/bob-boilen) and [Robin Hilton](https://www.npr.org/people/91465290/robin-hilton) to be funny and pleasant. This for me is more of a on-my-way-home-after-a-long-day-at-work sort of podcast. Can run close to 60 minutes sometimes. My two favorite seasonal episodes are the "best of the year so far" summer episode, and their year in review.
  * [The Moth]( https://themoth.org/about/programs/the-moth-podcast ) – Yet another NPR offering, real people telling real stories in front of a real audience without a script. This podcast used to be better curated. Now they seem be re-running the full "Moth Story Hour" as it aired on the radio, which runs a bit long for my taste.
  * [Ted Talks]( https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/tedtalks-audio/id160904630?mt=2 ) – I know its fashionable to hate on TED talks right now. But I love the cross-pollinating interdisciplinary daydreaming it provides. If you think this is a replacement for a graduate lecture, your just confused about TEDs mission.
  * [Decode DC]( https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/decodedc/id562274909?mt=2 ) – Andrea Seabrook is desperately trying to resurrect journalism, the media and Washington. Is this a fools errand? I am not sure, but I can't stop listening.

### Nerdy-ish:

  * [Ruby 5](https://ruby5.envylabs.com/) – As a Ruby developer, this one can't be missed. Release 2-3 times per week, these short episodes are sucicnt summaries of Ruby news. Also often humorous.
  * [Gweek]( https://boingboing.net/tag/gweek ) – A [BoingBoing](boingboing.net) podcast about books, comic books, and cool toys. Host [Mark Frauenfelder](https://boingboing.net/author/mark_frauenfelder_1) does a great job at always keeping Gweek down to 1 hour or less. Its too bad, because this is the one podcast I could listen to all day.
  * [Systematic]( https://5by5.tv/systematic ) – [Brett Terpstra](brettterpstra.com) is a developer designer. His show Systematic on the [5by5 Network](5by5.tv) is one of my favorites. He is known for having tried every pieces of software ever made. His show lately has been very diverse. He interviews basically any one who auditions, and who he finds interesting. I love this.
  * [The Ruby Rogues]( https://rubyrogues.com/ ) – These folks are pretty seriously nerdy and smart. I have never heard any podcast which even comes close to unpacking the real issues of developing big software. And they get it done. [James Edward Gray](https://twitter.com/JEG2), [Avdi Grimm](https://about.avdi.org/), [Josh Susser](https://blog.hasmanythrough.com/), and [Katrina Owen](https://kytrinyx.com/) bring in other heavy hitters to interview. Don't miss the episodes with [Ilya Grigorik](https://rubyrogues.com/135-rr-http-2-0-with-ilya-grigorik/) or [Sandi Metz](https://rubyrogues.com/087-rr-book-clubpractical-object-oriented-design-in-ruby-with-sandi-metz/).
  * [Escape Pod]( https://escapepod.org/ ) – The good people at [The Escape Artists](https://escapeartists.net/) really do a great service by finding writers, paying for their work, and then releasing that work as creative commons audio.
  * [Podcastle](https://podcastle.org/ ) – See above. Give them money.

#### Update January 31, 2014

A very savvy friend just recommened a the [On Being](https://www.onbeing.org/) podcast. I have only listened to one episode "Reimaging The Cosmos" so far, but it was fantastic. According to the website, On Being is:

    … about the big questions at the center of human life, from the boldest new science of the human brain to the most ancient traditions of the human spirit …

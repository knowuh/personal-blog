## Animation nodes experiment

I have been following the YouTube [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) video tutorials of [Zach Hixson](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Yypfyx5fKHpd640wPGFzQ)
about [Jacques Lucke's animation nodes](https://github.com/JacquesLucke/animation_nodes)
Animation nodes is an amazing tool and Zach explains things well. I encourage people to check out all of this.

[This week's tutorial by Zach](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JBYP426Olg) encouraged his followers
to reproduce a flipping tile animation using the `vector distance node`. Unfortunately I couldn't figure out how to post video responses on YouTube, so I am posting my homework here.

Here is the finished animation in low resolution animated gif format:

I hadn't made an animated gif in so long, I had to look around for tools.  I found [GIF Brewery 3](https://gifbrewery.com/) to be a great free tool. Available in the Apple App store for Mac OS.

Here is the animation nodes setup:

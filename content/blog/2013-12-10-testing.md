[Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) is a great Ruby based static site generator. If you have any
familiarity with [Sinatra](https://www.sinatrarb.com/) or [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), you will feel right at home with Middleman.

Out of the box, its just a static site generator.
There are many static site generators like:

 * [brunch](https://brunch.io/),
 * [jeckyl](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll )
 * [octopress](https://octopress.org/).

I have been using middleman for a while to build prototypes and toys, and I think its the hotness.
Its fast, clean, simple, and supports the markup systems I most use:

  * [haml](https://haml.info/)
  * [sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
  * [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
  * [coffeescript](https://coffeescript.org/)
  * [crazy-eddy many-more](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/templates/#toc_9)

It also has support for [blogging](https://middlemanapp.com/basics/blogging/), which is fantastic.

So this morning I decided that I would be happier rolling my
own blog using middleman instead of continuing to use wordpress.

I keep it versioned using Git, and update my site with a simple [rsync](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Darwin/Reference/ManPages/man1/rsync.1.html) alias, so publishing is basically a a few keystrokes away.

#### 2014-01-28 Update:

To try to reduce the friction of writing and publishing, I just created a few
[Automator](https://support.apple.com/kb/ht2488) workflows with key bindings
to turn selected text and images into blog entries.
Hopefully there will be more posts from me as a result.

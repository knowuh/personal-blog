In 2010 BlenderArtists forum memeber "Liero" gave us a cool script for
extruding faces multiple times.  I think more people should be aware
of this great tool.

Here is a screenshot of multi-extrude in action:

This tool can be used to easily make organic looking forms. It's also a
pretty simple script to read, so worth looking at if you are curious
about extending blender with python.

If you know more about Liero, let me know. I would like to personally
thank them for their work, and hopefully learn how to pronounce their
name.

Here is a link to the original [belnderartists.org
thread](https://blenderartists.org/forum/showthread.php?219526-Multiple-extrusions-script).
That thread links to several sources.  The script I used in the video 
was the [dropbox link](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/16486113/Blender/mexii.py)

I  copied that script to a [github
gist](https://gist.github.com/knowuh/5dacf4735137ac121428#file-mex) too.


Here my quick video showing how to install and use the "Multi Extrusions
Script". I hope you enjoy it.

Let me know if you think this sort of tip is worth recording.  

Also tell me about your favorite unsung favorite addons and scripts, so
that I can try them out, and publish them here.

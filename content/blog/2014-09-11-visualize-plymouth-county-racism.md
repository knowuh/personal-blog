What I learned about my county's demographics from US population data has caused a small interruption in my work day. Intellectually I have always known the story this data told me, but seeing the data in a map was shocking. Shocking enough to merit a few minutes to share.

From [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) I found the [The Racial Dot Map](https://demographics.coopercenter.org/DotMap/index.html). It graphs US Census population data from 2010. Its wonderful to look at. Go have a look.

While browsing around, I saw no racial diversity in my county. I wasn't shocked by this; I have known that Plymouth is a terribly homogeneous area. Its one of the reasons we want leave. Witness the ocean of blue caucasians in this image:

But then I noticed the area outlined in yellow. A high concentration of minorities on the map. It took me a minute to notice it, and then I assumed it was a glitch in the data. There just isn't that much high-density housing here. To double check I fired up Google Maps. That is when I reazlied all those little dots, were people _living in jail_.

This trend continues elsewhere in my libral democratic state. Correctional facilities are easily identifieble by the concentration of not-blue dots. [Try it yourself](https://demographics.coopercenter.org/DotMap/index.html). It's sobering, even when you know the [stats](https://www.naacp.org/pages/criminal-justice-fact-sheet).

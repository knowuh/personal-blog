  Blender experiment: pencil texture from scans

Computer generated images are characterized by their uncanny detail,
crisp focus, and vivid colors. These images often leave the viewers
minds underemployed. 

My experiments to re-engage the viewers eye and
re-introduce the hand of the artists into the digital process involve
pencils, paper, and scanners.

The popularity of photo filter apps like instagram reinforce the idea
that we appreciate, and maybe romanticize the imperfection
of the 'human hand'. Or possibly we are fascinated by chance events, and
celebrate the unpredictability of nature.

Using simulated depth of field, fake dirt  and virtual scratches I have
been deliberately reducing the fidelity, and legibility of these precise
digital renderings. I have thought about why these changes result in
more engaging imagery, but that post is for a different day.

These images were created by drawing imprecise geometric patters on
paper with graphite, then scanning the images at very high resolutions.
The scanned images of graphite and paper were then mapped on to (mostly)
random 3D meshes, in [Blender](https://blender.org)  using a top-down view projection for the UV
mappings.

The meshes were rendered using a very shallow depth of field in cycles
at 200 samples per pixel over 25M pixels. The high-resolution renders
were then mutilated by post-processing in [SnapSeed](https://bit.ly/1f2rheZ) 
-- an app that I run on my phone.

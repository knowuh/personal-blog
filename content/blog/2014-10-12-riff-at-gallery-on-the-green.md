Several of my works will be on display at [The Gallery On The Green](https://www.galleryonthegreen.org/), 5 Canton Green Rd., Canton, CT
from October 17th through November 16th 2014.

The show is called "Riff: A visual conversation between two artists", and it features work from 
my mother Diane Kennedy.

Here is what it says on the postcard: 

> **Riff**: A visual conversation between two artists. Diane Shanti Kennedy is a mixed media artist; 
> her son, Noah Paessel, creates "synthetic" digital images rendered by software. 
> They agreed to "riff" off each other's work. 
> The result is a stunning and playful collection of art in two 
> distinctly different styles and mediums with similar design elements and themes.

Here is a postcard for the show.  Contact me if you would like a PDF of the postcard:
